In the year 2021, a new dream of collaboration and expanding the business got off the ground and was registered unde the business name INKLAB GRAPHICS. An assortment of modern machinery was imported to meet the demands of the current world. Along with this, the business grew from a simple paper printong shop to an expensive branding firm; adding to its core: cup branding, t-shirt printing, embroidery and paper bag printing alon with the traditional paper printing( receipt books, business cards, posters, fliers & tickets). In 2024, the business became a fully fledged company under the name: INKLAB GRAPHICS LTD. Further, the company has added more office space. In future, the company seeks to join 3D printing.</p>
